A website about online privacy for school.\
This repository exists for my convenience so I don't have to manually upload to netlify (lol)\
And to prove my work of course :)\
Read the pages if you want, there is some interesting info.\
\
For presenting at school:\
This was my question:\
What are some of the myths about online privacy, how much data actually leaks when you don’t take your online privacy seriously, and what are the best ways to improve your online privacy?\
I researched about this topic (see [citations.html](citations.html)), and discovered more about this topic than I already knew.\
I had been looking into this topic a bit before this, but I wanted a way to share this info with others, and find credible sources so I can make sure I'm telling them the truth.\
This ended up taking longer than I expected, so I only have part I done.
