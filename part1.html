    <div class="text"><div class="text1"><p>To start, privacy is not the thing you are thinking of. You are actually thinking of secrecy. According to <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/en/basics/why-privacy-matters/#what-is-privacy">privacyguides.org</a>,<br>
        "This is a dangerous misconception, because it creates a sense that people who demand privacy must be <br>
        deviant, criminal, or wrong," and, "You shouldn't confuse privacy with secrecy. <br>
        We know what happens in the bathroom, but you still close the door. That's because you want privacy, not secrecy."<br><br>
        For the second myth, all Incognito mode does is it doesn't save your search history or cookies in your browser. <br><br>
        That's it. <br><br>
        Google can still track you (I'll dive more into that in a moment), your ISP can still see what you search. <br>
        That reminds me!<br><br>
        VPNs. They are advertised as the only thing you need for online privacy. But do they really do that?<br>
        The main, actually helpful thing they can do is change your location, which can help you access geo-fenced content <br>
        (which means there is a system in place where if it detects you are a country, it blocks/allows content.)<br>
        This could, for example, let you access shows that you can only watch in the EU.<br>

        </p></div></div>
    <div class="text"><div class="boldButNotAsBold"><p>But then you ask, with a slighly differed point of view,<br> "How much data ACTUALLY leaks when you don't take your privacy seriouly, then?"</p></div></div>
