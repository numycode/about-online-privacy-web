    <div class="text"><h1>Part I: The Myths</h1></div>
    <div class="text"><div class="text1"><p>To start, privacy is not the thing you are thinking of. You are actually thinking of secrecy. According to <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/en/basics/why-privacy-matters/#what-is-privacy">privacyguides.org</a>,<br>
        "This is a dangerous misconception, because it creates a sense that people who demand privacy must be <br>
        deviant, criminal, or wrong," and, "You shouldn't confuse privacy with secrecy. <br>
        We know what happens in the bathroom, but you still close the door. That's because you want privacy, not secrecy."<br><br>
        For the second myth, all Incognito mode does is it doesn't save your search history or cookies in your browser. <br><br>
        That's it. <br><br>
        Google can still track you (I'll dive more into that later), your ISP can still see what you search. <br>
        That reminds me!<br><br>
        VPNs. They are advertised as the only thing you need for online privacy. But do they really do that?<br>
        The main, actually helpful thing they can do is change your location, which can help you access geo-fenced content <br>
        (which means there is a system in place where if it detects you are in a certain country, it blocks/allows content.)<br>
        This could, for example, let you access shows that you can only watch in the EU, etc.<br>
        Another selling point is that they change your IP, but this could cause your bank's website to freak out and think you got hacked.<br>
        It also can help prevent websites from tracking you, since it changes your IP, but they can still find who you are from the info you put into the website, so it isn't a all-in-one solution.
        One last selling point is, "They stop you from getting hacked on public Wi-Fi!" HTTPS already does that! You know that lock on the side or the screen?<br>
        That prevents hackers from seeing exactly what you are doing, although they can see what website you are on. <br>
        Although, they can only see for example, example.com, not example.com/settings/account. Just make sure HTTPS is on before signing into a site on a public wifi!<br>
        VPNs can help, but they are not the end of online privacy, and don't automaticly make you anomyous.

    <div class="text"><div class="boldButNotAsBold"><p>But then you ask, with a slighly differed point of view,<br> "How much data ACTUALLY leaks when you don't take your privacy seriouly, then?"</p></div></div>
